integer num1
integer num2
integer sum
integer difference
integer product
float quotient

// Program to calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of 2 inputted numbers.
num1 = Get next input
num2 = Get next input

// The Sum
sum = num1 + num2
Put "The Sum is " to output
Put sum to output
Put ". /n" to output.

// The Difference
difference = num1 - num2
Put "The Difference is " to output
Put difference to output
Put ". /n" to output

// The product
product = num1 * num2
Put "The Product is " to output
Put product to output
Put ". /n" to output

// The quotient
quotient = num1 / num2
Put "The Quotient is "
Put quotient to output
Put ". /n"




// Step 1: Get two integer inputs from the user

// Step 2: Perform the four arithmetic operations, assigning to appropriate variable
// Assume for this program that second number is not zero, since we cannot divie by zero

// Step 3: Output the results
