# _About Me_

## _My Passions_
 I'm a pretty simple guy. I'm 32 and i've been a gamer since I was 6. I deeply enjoy Narrative and challenging gameplay. Expanding on my Critical thinking skills, Vocabulary, and abstract comprehension and conception. None of that mindless stuff that has become popular.
 > "_I'm a gamer, not because I don't have a life, but because I choose to have **many**._"

## _Websites I recommend_
1. The first website is a no-brainer for me. [Youtube.com](www.Youtube.com).

 The sheer amount of knowledge you can learn on it has risen exponetionally. Misinformation is always a concern, but can usually be deduced through pretty quickly. AI will most likely replace how people research and sift through information, but youtube really made it easy and popularized it in the first place. I grew up very poor in a troubled area so there are many large gaps in my common knowledge. Youtube just makes it very easy to fill those gaps without having to sift through definations, user manuals and forums.
 
2. My second is [NexusMods](www.NexusMods.com)

 Video games are simply made of a varity of codes. Because of this, some Gamers have reverse-engineered the codes, or simply gained developer tools, that allows them to change or modify the codes. This can rarely be done on a video game console, but on PC games, it can be very easy for gamers themselves to modify certain aspects of a video games code. For example, There was a gamer that personnally modified the start-up loading code for the game, _Grand Theft Auto 5_, reducing the load time by about 70%. This modification became so popular that the game developer purchased the code from the gamer and incorporated it into the game. It wouldn't suprise me if countless programmers became programmers because of their introduction to code through video game modifications.
